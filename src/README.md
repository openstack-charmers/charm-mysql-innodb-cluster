# Overview

This charm provides a MySQL 8 InnoDB clustered database.

Ubuntu 19.10 or above is required.

# Usage

The charm is intended for use deploying a cluster and therefore does not deploy on a single unit. 

## Cluster deployment

```
 juju deploy -n 3 mysql-innodb-cluster
```

The charm is designed to be used with the
[db-router relation](https://github.com/openstack-charmers/charm-interface-mysql-router)
in conjunction with the [MySQL Router charm](https://github.com/openstack-charmers/charm-mysql-router).

```
 juju add-relation mysql-innodb-cluster:db-router msyql-router:db-router
```

The charm can be related to existing charms that use the [shared-db relation](https://github.com/openstack/charm-interface-mysql-shared).
However, this should be considered deprecated.

```
 juju add-relation mysql-innodb-cluster:shared-db keystone:shared-db
```

## Scale out Usage

Nodes can be added to the cluster as Read Only nodes:

```
juju add-unit mysql-innodb-cluster
```

## Known Limitations and Issues

WARNING: This charm is in preview state.

The charm is under active development and is not yet production ready. It
current intended use is for validation of MySQL 8 InnoDB cluster used with
OpenStack.

# Configuration

cluster-name can be customized for the cluster deployment:

```
 juju config mysql-innodb-cluster cluster-name myCluster
```
